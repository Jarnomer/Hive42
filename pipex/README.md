# pipex

Chain unix command in style using pipes and forks üç¥.

## General

Goal of the project is to run multiple `unix` commands with `execve` by creating child processes with `fork` and communicating between them using `pipe`.

For studies perspective I `highly` recommend that you finish the `bonus` part of this project. It will serve you well in `minishell`.

## Usage

Execution needs an `infile` to open, `two` unix `commands` and `outfile` to `truncate` the result:

```bash
./pipex "Makefile" cat 'wc -l' outfile
```

Will be the same as bash syntax:

```bash
< Makefile cat | wc -l > outfile
```

## Bonus

Bonus supports `heredoc` and `multiple` unix commands. When heredoc is used, result is `appended` to outfile.

```bash
./pipex here_doc EOF cat cat 'wc -l' outfile
```

Will be the same as bash syntax:

```bash
<< EOF cat | cat | wc -l >> outfile
```

## Libft

This is the first project featuring `libft` with added `ft_printf` and `gnl`. All `linked list` functions are also included.

Additional deallocation functions were added for better memory management.

```c
ft_free_double((void ***)&ppx->cmd);
```

```c
void ft_free_double(void ***arr)
{
  int i;

  if (!arr || !*arr)
    return ;
  i = 0;
  while ((*arr)[i])
  {
    free((*arr)[i]);
    (*arr)[i] = NULL;
    i++;
  }
  free(*arr);
  *arr = NULL;
}
```

Project `passes` many of the 42 `testers`, including [franzinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) `strict` excluding quotes and backslashes.
