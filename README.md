## 📝 General

This repository holds all of my `42 school` projects @ [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/en/) between 0️⃣9️⃣:2️⃣3️⃣ - 0️⃣3️⃣:2️⃣5️⃣.

Studies are mostly done in `C` and `C++` programming languages while others such as JavaScript and Python are also introduced.

Main `topics` cover child prosessing, multithreating, networking, sorting algorithms and using Xorg with MLX API.

You can find my `error` handling unit `testers` for `pipex`, `so_long` and `cub3D` [here](https://github.com/Jarnomer/42Testers).
